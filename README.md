## Article:[Chrome to take ad blocking worldwide in July](https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/656311/chrome-take-ad-blocking-worldwide-july/?fp=4&fpid=611908207)

Starting from July 9, 2019, Chrome will implement ad-blocking for "disruptive ads" in any country. This has been an interesting topic to discuss because not even Google has given a clear definition of what "disruptive" really means. In the future, we can perhaps expect to see more ad-blockers in our browsers. Perhaps we can even take control and decide which kinds of ads we want to block. What is your definition of a "disruptive ad" and what kinds of ads would you like to filter out?
